When I first got the snake to move, I heard within my soul the maniacal voice of Dr. Frankenstein, *"It's aliiiiiivee!!"*

And yet...

I wasn't satiated.

I needed it to look and feel the way I remembered it on a Nokia 3310. It was the O.G. mobile app, the Candy Crush of the early aughts, that crowned this little brick by Nokia king. I remember then being charmed by the level of detail the programmers put into it and the intuitive user experience they delivered. I never anticipated the challenge ahead translating what they did with some dozens of pixels now equipped with modern programming languages. Stripped of the luxury of downloading a font, I wrote code for each letter: lower and uppercase, bold and lite. The end product allows you to choose between a more classic Snake I or Snake II, where the snake gains its stripes, teleports through walls, offers varying levels of difficulty and feeds on bonus prey.
